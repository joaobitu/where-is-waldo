# Where is Waldo

Play the famous "where is waldo" game, find wally, odlaw and wizard!
## Funcionalities

- A timer that counts upwards as you look for the characters!
- A dynamic text that displays the characters you are missing!
- An image that listens for clicks and Displays a model where you can take a guess!
- An option to add your time to the leaderboards (this goes to a backend)!
- A Display to show the top 10 scores on the leaderboards!


## Practiced Skills
This Project was incredibly fun! I had to figure out how to get the dynamic clicking on the image to work on any screen size, that is rather tricky! another thing that was new for em was the usage of a backend, here my usage is simple, adding and siplaying user Scores, but still... It's very neat to see it on the screen, and persisting across uses!
